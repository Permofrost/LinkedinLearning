# NOTE: 
If currently doing the Quantum Computing course on Linkedin Learning from either the path [Understanding Quantum Computing](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/understanding-quantum-computing?u=2169170) or the course [Quantum Computing Fundamentals](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/quantum-computing-fundamentals/pauli-x-gate-with-qiskit?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A624e1280498eef99568f1926&u=2169170) course, then the Quantum folder will be useful to you, as it contains the implementations from the course, except utilizing the more modern versions of the package's functions.

At the time of writing this (04 May 2024), the LinkedIn course uses deprecated functions that may cause issues if you don't use the codespaces or specific older packages that are given.
